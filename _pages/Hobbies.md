Hobbies
===
* Besides research, my hobbies are sports (including running, table tennis, and badminton), traveling, photography, and watching movies.
* Also, I'm very interested in memory palaces. I have trained in memory palaces and mastered the number coding system. I have memorized the first 1000 digits of pi by memory palaces.  In the realm of card memorization, I have honed my abilities to swiftly encode and recall information. I can memorize half a deck of poker cards in a mere 40 seconds. If you are also interested in memory palaces, welcome to talk with me.
