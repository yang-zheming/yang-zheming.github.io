Hobbies
===
* Besides research, my hobbies are sports (including running, table tennis, and badminton), traveling, photography, and watching movies.
* Also, I'm very interested in memory palaces. I have trained in memory palaces and mastered the number coding system. I have memorized the 1000 digits of pi.  And I can memory half a deck of cards only uses 40 seconds.
