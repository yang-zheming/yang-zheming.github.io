I am currently an assistant professor at the Intelligent Processor Research Center, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn/) in 2024, advised by Prof. [Wen Ji](https://ict.cas.cn/sourcedb/cn/jssrck/201011/t20101123_3028148.html). I have an exchange visit to the [High Performance Computing for Artificial Intelligence (HPC-AI) Lab](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/) at the National University of Singapore, advised by [Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/). 

My research interests include multimedia systems, edge/cloud computing, LLM inference optimization, and efficient AI system design. I have served as a reviewer of NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACM MM, AAAI, AISTATS, lEEE Transactions on ETCl, lEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine, etc. I am also actively involved in the standardization of the End-Edge-Cloud system. I am a member of the [IEEE Digital Retina Systems (3161 WG)](https://sagroups.ieee.org/3161/) Standards Working Group, which is the world's first international standards organization focused on vision end-edge-cloud systems.

🔥***Long-term Recruiting: I am looking for visiting students (bachelor, master, or Ph.D.), feel free to contact me at yangzheming@ict.ac.cn if interested in my research.***
